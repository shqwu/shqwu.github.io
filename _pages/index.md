Hi, I'm Shuaiqi Wu! I am currently a PhD Canditate in Atmospheric Science at UC Davis (Advisor: Prof. [Erwan Monier](https://lawr.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/monier-erwan)). My research focuses on using Crop Models (both statistical and process-based) to investigate the responses of crops :corn: to future climate :sunny: and extreme weather :snowflake:. I aim to help farmers to avoid harvest failure and maximize crop yields:smile:!!!
