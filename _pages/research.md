## Almonds in California 

I developed a novel approach to enhance the modeling of climate and technological innovation impacts on perennial crops, using California almonds as a case study. Collaborating with plant scientists, biometeorology specialists, and agricultural engineers, I identified key environmental conditions affecting each almond growth stage and defined them as agro-climate indices (ACIs). My study projected future yield changes under two high-resolution multi-model ensemble simulations (MACA and LOCA), identified key yield loss drivers, and quantified their impacts. This research bridges climate and crop science to provide almond growers with actionable insights for climate adaptation and innovation investment.

## A Gridded Python-based AquaCrop calirbated for Maize

AquaCrop, developed by the FAO, simulates crop growth and responses to water stress while balancing simplicity, robustness, and accuracy. To enhance model flexibility and enable large-scale simulations, I developed a gridded Python-based version of AquaCrop. I designed and implemented a county-level calibration approach for maize across the U.S., utilizing large-scale datasets on climate, soil properties, irrigation management, and crop calendars.
